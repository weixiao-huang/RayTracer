# Ray Tracer

## Introduction
Ray Tracer is a small renderer by using Progressive Photon Mapping (PPM) to render the scene.

## Build
You can define your image size in the `main.cpp` file and define your scene in the `scene.cpp` file.

Then you can build your renderer by the following codes:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
then you can find the binaries file to run.
